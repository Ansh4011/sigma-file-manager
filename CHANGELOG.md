# CHANGELOG

## v1.1.0 (2021-27-05)

# Release Notes for v1.1.0:

âš **Warning:** the app is in early development stage, use with caution! Before using the app, it's recommended, to copy important files to your cloud storage or an external drive in case something goes wrong. Try not to use it for working with important files, until it's thoroughly tested.

## Milestones:

ðŸ”¼ **by v2.0.0 (Oct 2021):** (1/20) Add 20 more new major features

## New major features:
- **Quick view:** this feature allows you to quickly open selected files in a preview window, rather than an external program (which usually takes longer). Quick view can be opened with `Space` shortcut or from the context menu. Supported: images, videos, audio, PDF, most plain text formats.
