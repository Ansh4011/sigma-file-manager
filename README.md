# Features

The list of major features:

#### FEATURE #1 | SMART GLOBAL SEARCH

The search system in this app allows you to quickly find any file / directory on your computer in just a few seconds. For example, to find a file called `"2019 - Document Name.txt"`, you can type something like `"documen 2019"` (with typos, wrong case, wrong word order, missing words, missing symbols, and missing file extension) and the app will quickly find it for you (searches take about 1 second per 50 GB of data on medium tier computers).

#### FEATURE #2 | TABS

Tabs allow you to quickly switch between multiple directories with a click or a shortcut: `Alt + [0-9]`.

#### FEATURE #3 | WORKSPACES

Workspaces greatly increase your productivity by allowing you to quickly switch between separate workflows, which is especially useful when you work on multiple projects at the same time. Each workspace has its own set of tabs and its own actions. Actions can perform different operations, e.g. open a website, run a script, open a file in a specific program, etc.

#### FEATURE #4 | ADVANCED WIRELESS FILE SHARING

This feature allows you to wirelessly share a directory or stream any file to your local devices (connected to your network) in 2 clicks without installing any apps. It works on any device with a modern web browser (smart TVs, mobile devices, laptops, virtual machines, etc).

**Note:** make sure to allow the app access to the network in Firewall when prompted.

#### FEATURE #5 | ADDRESS BAR

Address bar lets you quickly navigate directories with your keyboard. It autocompletes file names and automatically opens directories as you type.

#### FEATURE #6 | ITEM FILTER

Item filter allows you to quickly filter out items (notes / files / directories) from the list so you don't have to scroll through hundreds of items trying to find the one you need. It supports advanced glob patterns and property prefixes (for specifying exact properties you want to filter).

>**Note:** It doesn't use the global search's typo correction algorithm yet. I will added in the future updates.

#### FEATURE #7 | ADVANCED FILE DOWNLOADER

This feature allows you to stream / download any file from the internet just by dragging it (or its link) onto the app.

It supports all file types, including videos and video streams (with or without auth tokens / URL timestamps).

**Warning:** do not abuse this feature. If you download a lot of content from certain services, consider supporting them in some way, at least by disabling your ad blocker on their website or even buying their premium subscriptions to support both the service and the content creators on it. Otherwise, we won't have nice things like free education, entertainment, communities, creative freedom and other great things that these platforms provide us with.

#### FEATURE #8 | SMART DRAG & DROP

The drag & drop feature is designed to simplify data transfers. It not only allows you to easily download files from the internet, it also provides a very comfortable way of transferring local files both within the app itself and other apps.

#### FEATURE #9 | SHORTCUTS

Most actions within the app can be performed with shortcuts. Even the app itself can be opened / closed with a global (system wide) customizable shortcut. This feature helps you work more efficiently and makes the process more enjoyable (e.g. you can instantly open the app and create a new note with just 1 shortcut).

#### FEATURE #10 | CUSTOMIZABLE HOME PAGE BANNER

The home page of the app has a unique, recognizable feature - a customizable media background (banner). You can set a custom image / video or choose one of the built-in artworks (kindly provided to me by the artists) and personalize the app to your liking.

#### FEATURE #11 | NOTES

Advanced note editor in this app allows you to create featureful notes and store them in one convenient, quickly accessible place.

#### FEATURE #12 | DASHBOARD

Dashboard page provides a quick access to pinned / protected / tagged items, and the timeline.

#### FEATURE #13 | FILE PROTECTION

This feature allows you to protect any file / directory / note from being modified / renamed / moved / deleted.

#### FEATURE #14 | INFO PANEL

Info panel displays useful information about the currently selected file / directory:

- Properties like "size", "path", "symlink path", "permissions", etc.;

- File preview for media files: audio, video, images (including animated gifs, apng, webp, and many other formats);

#### FEATURE #15 | ARCHIVER

Built-in archiver allows you to compress files into archives and extract existing archives. It supports all most popular formats:
  - **Packing / unpacking:** 7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP, WIM.
  - **Unpacking only:** AR, ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DMG, EXT, FAT, GPT, HFS, IHEX, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, QCOW2, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, UDF, UEFI, VDI, VHD, VMDK, WIM, XAR, Z.

#### FEATURE #16 | QUICK VIEW

This feature allows you to quickly open selected files in a preview window, rather than an external program (which usually takes longer). Quick view window can be opened with `Space` shortcut or from the context menu. Supported file types: images, videos, audio, PDF, most plain text formats.

#### FEATURE #17 | AUTO UPDATES

The app updates itself automatically. It will let you decide if and when you want to download and install an update.

#### FEATURE #18 | CUSTOMIZABLE, WELL THOUGHT-OUT, MODERN DESIGN

This app is designed to pack lots of advanced features, without sacrificing customizable, minimalistic, modern design and usability. This idea propogates all the way to the smallest features of the app.

#### FEATURE #19 | COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

Anyone can join this community, participate in the development of this app, and learn in the process.

#### MANY MORE FEATURES ARE COMING

Several more major features / improvements are already in development and will be added in the next updates.

#### ‚ö† Warnings:

The app is still in early development (prototyping) stage.

- The app hasn't been thoroughly tested yet. It's recommended to backup (copy) all of your important data to an external backup drive or to cloud storage before installing and using this app.
- Expect to see some errors and performance issues in the first versions of the app. I will be fixing the problems gradually as they get reported by the users.
- The app has not been optimized yet, RAM usage can spike and go over 1 GB during some operations. So, for now, avoid using the app on low-tier computers (i.e. computers with 4 GB of RAM or less).

#### üí¨ Get notified

You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/hoffman_aleksey" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you want to get updates on this app, hear about my upcoming projects, participate in my future giveaways, or just hear my thoughts on different things.

If you just want to get updates on this project, you can click the "watch" button on top of the page.

#### üí° Hidden treasures

There's a fun secret hidden somewhere in the app. See if you can find it. Hint: only the dinosaur knows about it.

# The app background story

Even though I've spent 3000+ hours developing this app, I decided to make it free and open-source because open-source is more than just a way to share your work, it has larger impact on the development of our society than you think.

When we create close-sourced, overly-copyrighted products, and hide our work behind paywalls and patents, with the primary goal of enriching yourself, we slow down our development.

As history has shown us, when we share our knowledge with each other freely and build upon each other's work, we increase the rate of our technological development, which improves well-being of everyone as a result. Science is the greatest example of what shared collaborative work can do for us. This is why open-source and open-content concepts are so important. Projects like this wouldn't be possible without it.

Relying on donations is no doubt a less profitable model, but I think it's better when the people who use your work are the ones who determine how much support you receive. This is how we incentivize and motivate creators to improve, to make better, more useful, more enriching products / artworks / software / technologies.

By creating this app, I also wanted to show every beginner that no project is too big for your skills - all you need to do is just start making it, work hard on it every day, learn in the process, and simply don't stop until you create something really good. That's the secret to creating something great.

This app is an example of what dedication can do for you - when I started this project I could barely code, and in just 2 years of work with budget of $0, the dedication allowed me to create an app, which in version 1.0 in some aspects can already compete with apps like MacOS "Finder" and Windows "File Explorer" which has been in development for 24+ years by a trillion dollars worth company's team of many highly paid professional developers and designers each of whom has specialized skills, experience, all the resources, tools, and computing power in the world, including super computers, AI algorithms, neural networks, the ability to employ any specialist in the world, and the enormous amounts of data. And despite not having any of this, you can still make a competitive product, if you just start making it and keep working on it. But as I said earlier, this is only possible in the world where we build upon each other's work, rather than hiding our work and experience from each other behind patents and copyrights.

This is how and why "Sigma file manager" was created. It all started from a simple idea of making a concept design, but thanks to other open-source developers, who also decided to share their work with the world, I was able to turn this idea into a quickly evolving app with great potential. Building something for others also gave me a lot of ideas for more impactful projects, some of which are already in development.
